# scrapy-crawler


Steps to Implement an AKS-Based Batch Crawling System
Containerize Each Spider:

Each Scrapy spider (or batch process) is designed to crawl a specific website.
Containerize these spiders so they can run independently.
Use AKS for Deployment:

Deploy each spider as a separate Pod in AKS.
Manage these Pods using Kubernetes Jobs or CronJobs.
Dynamic Configuration:

Pass website-specific configurations (like URL, selectors, etc.) as environment variables or configuration files to the Pods.
Implement Queue System (Optional):

Use a message broker (e.g., Azure Service Bus or RabbitMQ) to queue crawl jobs and dynamically trigger Pods.
Centralize Results:

Use Azure Blob Storage to store the crawled results.
Process bad data in a quarantine container.


Detailed Implementation
1. Scrapy Spider Setup
Create individual spiders or a parameterized spider for different websites. For instance:

multi_filings.py:
A single spider can take website-specific arguments via environment variables or configuration.
Example: multi_filings.py with dynamic input:



Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t scrapy-crawler .
3. Deploy to AKS
Create an AKS Cluster:

Use Azure CLI:
bash
Copy code
az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 3 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys
Push Docker Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR):

bash
Copy code
az acr build --registry myRegistry --image scrapy-crawler .
