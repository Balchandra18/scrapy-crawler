Steps to Implement an AKS-Based Batch Crawling System
Containerize Each Spider:

Each Scrapy spider (or batch process) is designed to crawl a specific website.
Containerize these spiders so they can run independently.
Use AKS for Deployment:

Deploy each spider as a separate Pod in AKS.
Manage these Pods using Kubernetes Jobs or CronJobs.
Dynamic Configuration:

Pass website-specific configurations (like URL, selectors, etc.) as environment variables or configuration files to the Pods.
Implement Queue System (Optional):

Use a message broker (e.g., Azure Service Bus or RabbitMQ) to queue crawl jobs and dynamically trigger Pods.
Centralize Results:

Use Azure Blob Storage to store the crawled results.
Process bad data in a quarantine container.
